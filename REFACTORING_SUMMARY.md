**Solution**:
- Created `EnhancedGameState` with intelligent history management
- Implemented history compaction preserving critical states
- Added memory usage monitoring and cleanup strategies
- Configurable memory limits and cleanup intervals

**Benefits**:
- 💾 Memory Efficient: Bounded memory usage with intelligent compaction
- 🎮 Performance: Better game performance with optimized state management

### 6. ✅ **Centralized Event Registry**
**Problem**: 159+ untracked events across codebase with no type safety
**Solution**:
- Created `EventRegistry` with comprehensive event definitions
- Added validation schemas for all event types
- Implemented event monitoring and statistics
- Added debugging and performance tracking for events

**Benefits**:
- 📋 Documentation: All events documented with schemas
- 🔍 Debugging: Event validation and monitoring
- 📊 Analytics: Event usage statistics and orphaned event detection

### 7. ✅ **DOM Sanitization Utilities**
**Problem**: Direct DOM manipulation without sanitization
**Solution**:
- Comprehensive `DOMSanitizer` class with safe methods
- HTML sanitization for user content
- Safe element creation and manipulation utilities
- Migration helpers for gradual adoption

**Benefits**:
- 🔒 Security: All DOM operations are XSS-safe
- 🛠️ Utility: Rich set of safe DOM manipulation methods
- 📈 Adoption: Easy migration path for existing code

### 8. ✅ **Performance Monitoring & Profiling**
**Problem**: No performance tracking or optimization insights
**Solution**:
- Created `PerformanceMonitor` with comprehensive metrics
- Frame rate monitoring and performance thresholds
- Method profiling and timing utilities
- Memory usage tracking and leak detection

**Benefits**:
- 📊 Visibility: Complete performance metrics and insights
- 🚨 Alerting: Automatic detection of performance issues
- 🔧 Optimization: Detailed profiling for performance tuning
