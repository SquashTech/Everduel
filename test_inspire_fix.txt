Test Instructions for Inspire Fix:

1. Load the game (http://localhost:8080)
2. Start any scenario (e.g., "Easy Mode")
3. Choose any champion
4. Use Max Gold button (`) to get gold
5. Draft some units to place on battlefield
6. Get an Inspire spell (if not in starting hand, purchase from Spellbook)
7. Cast Inspire spell
8. Check if battlefield units now show increased attack stats (should be +3 attack visible)

Expected Behavior After Fix:
- Units should show +3 attack in their display after Inspire
- Console should show "ðŸ”„ Forcing UI update after spell buff"
- UI signature should include attack values, preventing duplicate update skipping
- Attack stats should be visually displayed on units

Check the browser console for:
- Spell buff application logs
- Force UI update log
- UI update execution logs
