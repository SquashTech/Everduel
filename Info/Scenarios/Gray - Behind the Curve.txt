The player starts with 2 max gold and the AI starts with 3 max gold.

The AI goes first and the player goes second.

Otherwise, the rules are the same as normal.

Description for UI:
"It's like the opponent played a ramp spell on turn 0 and they're going first. Still the same easy AI, but a bit more difficult than Easy Mode."
