Battlefield Integration:
Line of Sight functions identically to the spell Reinforce
When clicking Quick Escape, the player's units in-play will be highlighted. Selecting any of them will immediately remove Quick Escape from hand, then move that unit to their hand.
Archery Tower functions exactly like Frost Wall, except for the back row.
When clicking Rain of Arrows, the player's battlefield will glow. Clicking in the battlefield casts the spell. Dealing damage in a column is a source of damage that is deterministically
targeted just like a normal attack (Front Row -> Back Row -> Enemy Player).
